            <p>
                Hello! My name is Kyle McColgan. I'm a technology professional proudly based in Saint Louis, Missouri. I specialize in full-stack web development and information security, with a focus on building secure, scalable solutions that aim for real-world impact.

            <p>
                Outside of work, I can be found outside enjoying nature through hikes, bird watching, or stargazing with my telescope. I’m also into mystery audiobooks and other genres, live concerts, and giving back to the community through volunteering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working on projects that are thoughtful and meaningful, and I’m always open to learning something new. If anything here resonates, I’d be thrilled to connect!!
            </p>
