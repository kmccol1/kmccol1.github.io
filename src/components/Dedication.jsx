            <p>
                This website is lovingly dedicated to my family and closest friends, who have been my rock throughout every step of my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                To my parents, who taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and integrity—your guidance has been my foundation. To my friends, whose encouragement has lifted me through both triumphs and challenges—your belief in me has been a constant source of strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without your unwavering support and love, none of this would have been possible. Every line of code, every design choice, and every late-night refinement is a reflection of the inspiration you've given me. This project stands as a testament to the strength, wisdom, and kindness you have shared with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you—for your presence, your patience, and your unwavering faith in me.
            </p>
